# set-timezone-cli

CLI tool to set your timezone based on a place name.

```
npm install -g set-timezone-cli
set-timezone copenhagen
```

Currently works on Mac. PR welcome for more platforms.

## Motivation

Try opening the world map and click try and hit Copenhagen.
Once you've hit Berlin and Hamburg a couple of times just install this :)
